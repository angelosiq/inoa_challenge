## Inoa challenge

If you're running this project for the first time, make sure to create its env variables locally using the commmand:

`make create-env`

Build the project using:

`make docker/build`

Then finally run it using:

`make run`

That should do it!
Now go to the frontend [repository](https://github.com/angelosiq/inoa_challenge_front).
